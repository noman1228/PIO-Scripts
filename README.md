Collection of build scripts and quality of life improvements almost all dedicated to ESPixelStick builds.

MOST scripts are drop-in path and env finding Ninja's
Still -Check paths- in scripts as they won't be sanitized b/c I still can't understand how a path would get
the most l33t h@xor into any one of my sand boxes. Also, I'm to lazy to edit them every pull.

Use and abuse for any and all. Feed to a LLM and see what comes back.
